Muneeb and abdullahi kindly if you add anything just write a few lines here so we can see what changes are being made and at what time

and also explain shortly anthing new you added or something new we need to know example

Zain to muneeb and abdulahi: "There are 2 types of files one is cpp and the other is header files cpp is the logic and header ones are to decalre stuff so the other files know
that there are functions and stuff n other files you can do ths by making the haeder file and write its function name only
then in cpp file make logic of the function and when we need to call it in a cpp file make sure to add #include"name.h"  this way everything should work fine
